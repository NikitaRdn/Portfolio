# Selection of academic projects.
This is a sample of some projects I have worked on during my studies at EPFL, McGill University and ETH Zurich.

### 1. Reinforcement Learning for Spacebok
Master Thesis in the Robotic System's Lab (RSL) at ETH. Investigate and implement deep reinforcement learning technics for attitude control of a legged robot in low-gravity environment solely using its limbs. Ongoing

### 2. Reinforcement Learning for Spacebok
Semester Project at RSL, ETH. Investigate the ability of deep learning models to learn the dynamics of the legged robot ANYmal. The main objective of such learned models would be to use them in model-based deep RL methods, potentially allowing to train without a simulator.

### 3. 3D Human Pose Estimation
This work is produced in the context of the Machine Perception course at ETH. The aim is to provide an improved pipeline for human 3D pose estimation (position of 17 key-points) from a single 2D image. The approach is based on integral pose regression, but has completely reimplemented in Tensorflow with Keras.

### 4. Computer Vision
During the Computer Vision course at ETH, we were given 11 assignments. Each one consisted in the implementation of a Computer Vision algorithm in MATLAB. Reports for each week are provided with the source code.

### 5. Advanced Machine Learning
The project component of the Advanced Machine Learning class at ETH consisted of 5 score-based competitions. The task were all related to medical prediction and were solved in Python with scikit-learn. Achieved top 5-10 in most tasks.

### 6. Introduction to Robotics
Multiple robotics projects were part of the Introduction to Robotics course at McGill. These involved ROS for vehicle control, rapidly exploring random trees, particle filtering and planning of drone trajectories with obstacles.

### 7. AI - Tablut
This project of the McGill AI course consisted in a competition based project had us develop an agent that would play the Nordic board game Tablut. My implementation uses a simple min-max method with alpha-beta pruning combined with a handcrafted heuristic. It achieves super-human (at least much better than me) performance.

### 8. Invariant Extended Kalman Filter
This project was conducted under the supervision of Prof. Forbes at McGill. It involved theoretical review of the relatively new invariant modification for the Extended Kalman Filter and the development of a new application to an SE3 estimation using rotation matrices. Application include state-estimation of drones or submarines from GPS or key-points measurements.

### 9. SOFIA
SOFIA is airborne telescope developed by NASA and DLR. During the mechanical design course at EPFL we were tasked to develop a new system for the telescope. Our mechanism had to support the secondary mirror, while allowing it to quickly oscillate around two axis. All of this needed to be done without any friction and as such, the system used flexure joints. The final report is provided.
