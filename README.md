# Selection of academic projects.
This is a sample of some projects I have worked on during my studies at EPFL, McGill University and ETH Zurich.
Content:
*	Implementation of model-based (deep) reinforcement learning techniques on the ANYbotics legged robot ANYmal. _Ongoing_
*	Estimation of human 3D skeleton from a 2D image. _Ongoing_
*	5 Machine Learning competition-based projects.
*	Implementation of various Computer Vision algorithms in MATLAB. Including: epipolar geometry, dense 3D reconstruction, image classification, tracking etc….
*	Multiple robotics projects involving ROS for vehicle control, rapidly exploring random trees, particle filtering and planning of drone trajectories with obstacles.
*	Report on the theory of the Invariant modification of the Extended Kalman Filter and an application to an SE3 estimation using rotation matrices.
*	Design of an advanced mechanical system based on flexure joints for the NASA’s SOFIA airborne telescope. Resulting grade: 
*	Finite elements analysis and optimization of an asymmetric, nonlinear design for a highly sensitive gravitometer.
