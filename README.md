#Selection of academic projects.
This is a representative sample of some projects I have worked on during my studies at EPFL, McGill University and ETH Zurich.
Content:
•	Implementation of model-based (deep) reinforcement learning techniques on the ANYbotics legged robot ANYmal. Ongoing
•	Estimation of human 3D skeleton from a 2D image. Ongoing
•	5 Machine Learning competition-based projects. Top 2-10% score in each.
•	Implementation of various Computer Vision algorithms in MATLAB. Including: epipolar geometry, dense 3D reconstruction, image classification, tracking etc…. 98% average score.
•	Multiple robotics projects involving ROS for vehicle control, rapidly exploring random trees, particle filtering and planning of drone trajectories with obstacles. Results: 95-100% 
•	Report on the theory of the Invariant modification of the Extended Kalman Filter and an application to an SE3 estimation using rotation matrices. Result: 95%
•	Design of an advanced mechanical system based on flexure joints for the NASA’s SOFIA airborne telescope. Resulting grade: 6.0/6.0
•	Finite elements analysis and optimization of an asymmetric, nonlinear design for a highly sensitive gravitometer. Result: 100%
